### To run both frontend and backend:
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`


### Good to Know: 
- `/reviews/` route is currently the page containing reviews (hard-coded data)
- Commet out the `<div>...<Form /> ...</div>` section in `App.tsx` if you want to see the original frontend we had


### Stuff to work on:
- Think about if we want to add number into db ie. 24 correspond to Cayon Vista or if we want to convert number to specific restaurants first before storing them to DB
- be able to post by calling `/api/post` from frontend
- figure out image with amazon s3
